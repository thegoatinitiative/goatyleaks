# Goat Initiative Telegram Monitor

Tracking infrastructure & selector observables potentially associated with PRC-linked talent-recruitment and non-traditional collectors operating on Telegram.

## 🎯 Purpose

The **Goat Initiative** is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection and analysis effort focused on:

- Identifying Telegram channels, groups, and private chats used for talent spotting, initial contact, and coordination by actors linked to PRC state interests
- Documenting selector patterns, language, thematic content, and operational security (OPSEC) behaviors
- Building a structured, timestamped corpus of observables to support defensive counterintelligence, academic research, and public awareness

This repository **does not** contain any personally identifiable information (PII), direct chat logs, or non-public targeting material. All shared content has been heavily sanitized / redacted or is already publicly visible.

- No hacking, credential stuffing, phishing, malware distribution, or unauthorized access is involved or condoned
- All data shared here complies with applicable laws of the United States and the platform’s terms of service (to the best of our knowledge at time of publication)

## 🛠️ Current Scope (2025–2026)

- Telegram channels & groups advertising "overseas opportunities", "talent programs", "consulting gigs", "think-tank fellowships", "academic collaboration", etc. with indicators consistent with known PRC United Front / MSS / PLA-linked recruitment patterns
- Monitoring selector language evolution post-2024 U.S. DOJ indictments and public exposure campaigns
- Collecting public-facing recruiter personas, avatar patterns, username conventions, invite-link hygiene
